# Zero Carbon Cross Energy System - Phase 2 (ZO.RRO II)
## Thuringian energy research project ZO.RRO II supports industrial companies in designing a climate-friendly energy supply
 
In order to optimize the use of energy resources and thus reduce CO2 emissions, a consortium of the Nordhausen University of Applied Sciences (HSN) and the Thuringian Renewable Energies Network (ThEEN) e.V. has come together in Thuringia.
The initial results from the project, called ZO.RRO (Zero Carbon Cross Energy System), have made an impression, and one of the co-initiators – HSN’s Institute for Renewable Energy Technology – was awarded the Thuringian “Digital and Open-Source Award”. 
In the meantime, the first phase of concept development has been completed, and the project will be continued in Phase II with funding from the Thuringian Ministry for the Environment, Energy and Nature Conservation (TMUEN). 

### Project Goal

The objective of the current demonstration phase is to holistically optimize the energy supply of Thuringian industrial companies to prove their carbon footprint and to reduce it.
