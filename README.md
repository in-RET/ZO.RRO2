# Zero Carbon Cross Energy System - Phase 2 (ZO.RRO II)
## Thuringian energy research project ZO.RRO II supports industrial companies in designing a climate-friendly energy supply
 
In order to optimize the use of energy resources and thus reduce CO2 emissions, a consortium of the Nordhausen University of Applied Sciences (HSN) and the Thuringian Renewable Energies Network (ThEEN) e.V. has come together in Thuringia.
The initial results from the project, called ZO.RRO (Zero Carbon Cross Energy System), have made an impression, and one of the co-initiators - HSN's Institute for Renewable Energy Technology - was awarded the Thuringian "Digital and Open-Source Award". 

The much-cited study ["So geht's - How Thuringia can become climate-neutral (...)"](https://umwelt.thueringen.de/fileadmin/user_upload/So_gehts_Buchblock_Druck.pdf) by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Viktor Wesselak, Professor of Regenerative Energy Technology at Nordhausen University of Applied Sciences, was further developed. 
After the scientists in the ZO.RRO I project in November 2021 showed transformation paths to 2050, calculations were carried out in the continuation with the energy system modeling for climate neutrality in the Free State by 2035.
The researchers conclude that by calculation, climate neutrality is also feasible and affordable sooner, although the simulation tool does not factor in the time required for the processes of land allocation, skilled labor acquisition, and permitting of renewable energy facilities. 
In the meantime, the first phase of concept development has been completed, and the project will be continued in Phase II with funding from the Thuringian Ministry for the Environment, Energy and Nature Conservation (TMUEN). 

### Project Goal

The objective of the current demonstration phase is to holistically optimize the energy supply of Thuringian industrial companies to prove their carbon footprint and to reduce it. 
In the ZO.RRO II state project, the open-source software is used as a third tool for the demonstrator companies to determine the economically and ecologically optimal climate-neutral energy supply.
Similar to the case study of Thuringia, scenarios are developed step by step together with the companies according to their targets, which show how the energy demand can be met at any time.
Suitable options, for example, are the use of (additional) photovoltaics in combination with energy storage, the use of heat pumps and electromobility. 
ZO.RRO additionally considers the possibility of demand side management in order to be able to react even better to future price fluctuations.
This refers to an adjustment of energy consumption in which temporally independent production stages take place when sufficient low-cost, renewable energy is available.

* detailed measurements to evaluate suitable options in energy supply
* identification of hidden savings potentials and largest CO2 sources
* economic and ecological evaluation of individual plants
* verification of CO2 footprint and sustainable development
* optimization of the design of new plants and supply concepts (e.g. by using photovoltaics, energy storage, flexibility potentials, electromobility)
